# udp_latency_test_for_GA
**udp_latency_test_for_GA** is a set of scripts for testing server and client delays, including udp server and udp client. 
After using AWS Global Accelerator, the edge node will quickly return after receiving the tcp and icmp packets, which is not very friendly to the delay test. Therefore, after using GA, UDP can be used for delay testing.
